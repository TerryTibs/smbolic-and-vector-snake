it should be able to be adapted to things like self driving or controlling a robot. thats what I will try next. it needs some sort of machine vision with object and people recognition added. it needs like a GPS added and the game changing from a basic snake game to a 2d and 3d driving environment. once 1 car is being controlled correctly and driving then I want to create 10 cars all with them being controlled individually but a model and another model that looks at the entire city the cars are driving in and trying to delegate to each car to try and more efficiently get the cars to there destinations without crashing etc
